# Confidence Builder

Confidence Builder is a web-based application designed to help individuals with social anxiety boost their confidence and overcome their fears in public situations. The application provides a series of daily tasks and activities that users can engage in to gradually build their self-assurance and improve their social skills.

This project was developed as a personal initiative by [Your Name] to provide a fun activity and support system for individuals, including myself, who experience social anxiety. It aims to create a safe and encouraging environment for practicing and developing social skills.

## Features

- **Daily Tasks**: Users are presented with a set of tasks to complete each day, focusing on various aspects of confidence-building and social interaction.
- **Task Tracking**: Users can mark tasks as completed and track their progress over time.
- **Points and Levels**: Users earn points for completing tasks, and their progress is reflected through leveling up as they accumulate more points.
- **Local Storage**: User data, including tasks and progress, is stored locally in the browser using the browser's built-in local storage feature.
